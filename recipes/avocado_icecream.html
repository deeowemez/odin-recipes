        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Avocado ice cream is a chilled dessert that uses any ice cream base flavored with avocadoes. Our avocado ice cream recipe is made with heavy cream, condensed milk, milk, sliced avocadoes, and it also has crushed almonds for that extra crunchy bite.
